# Stateless vs Stateful widget
1. Stateless Widget
   A StatelessWidget is a widget that does not change its appearance during the app’s lifetime. Once it is built, it remains the same.
2.  Stateful Widget
    A StatefulWidget is a widget that can change dynamically when triggered (e.g., by user interaction). It can be rebuilt multiple times during the app’s lifetime.

## Understanding Code
`class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {
@override
_MyAppState createState() => _MyAppState();
}`
- MyApp is a StatefulWidget.
- It extends StatefulWidget, which means it can change its state over time.
- The method createState() is overridden to return an instance of _MyAppState, which will manage 
  the state of MyApp.

The actual state is defined in the _MyAppState class:

    `class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
    int counter = 0; // State variable
    
    void incrementCounter() {
    setState(() {
    counter++; // Updating state
    });
    }
    
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    }`

The context parameter is an instance of BuildContext, which provides information about:
- Where the widget is located in the widget tree.
- Accessing theme, size, or localization settings.
- Navigating to new screens.

# goRouter
go_router is a navigation package in Flutter that helps us move between pages (screens) easily and efficiently.
🔹 Without go_router: You use Navigator.push() and Navigator.pop(), which can be complicated.
🔹 With go_router: You just "go" to a new page using a simple command.

    `GoRoute(
      path: '/',
      builder: (context, state) => HomePage(),
    ),`

    `GoRoute(
      path: '/details/:message', // Dynamic Path (Pass Data)
      builder: (context, state) {
        final message = state.pathParameters['message'] ?? 'No message';
        return DetailsPage(message: message);
      },
    ),`

    `ElevatedButton(
    onPressed: () {
    context.go('/details/HelloFlutter'); // Passing "HelloFlutter" to Details Page
     },
    child: Text('Go to Details Page with Data'),
    );`

🔹 context.go() is used to navigate to a new page.
🔹 context.push() is used to push a new page on top of the current page (thus, back button works).
🔹 context.pop() is used to go back to the previous page.

# ref in Riverpod
Riverpod is a state management package for Flutter. It helps manage app state efficiently without using setState()
🔹 ref is a parameter in Riverpod that allows you to read, write, and listen to state changes.

## Using ref to watch a state
    `final counterProvider = StateProvider<int>((ref) => 0);
    final counter = ref.watch(counterProvider);`

🔹 StateProvider<int> → Holds an integer value (counter).
🔹 ref → Helps manage the state (get, update, or watch changes).
🔹 watch() → Listens to changes in the state.

🔹 ref.watch(provider)	Listens to changes (Rebuilds UI when value changes)
🔹 ref.read(provider)	Reads value once (Does not rebuild UI)
🔹 ref.read(provider.notifier).state	Updates the value (Changes the state)

🔹 What if I want to detect state changes but don’t want to rebuild the widget?
- Use ref.listen() inside ConsumerStatefulWidget.
