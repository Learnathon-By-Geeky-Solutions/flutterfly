# Single Responsibility Principle

Every class should have one responsibility only. There should be only one reason for a class to change.

Example: Suppose you defined a class named ‚ÄòTransaction‚Äô with two methods: ‚ÄòtransferMoney‚Äô and ‚ÄògetHistory‚Äô. Does this follow the single responsibilty principle? No. Because it has two responsibilities. Soln? Create two different classes.

# Open/Closed Principle

‚ÄúSoftware entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification‚Äù
Team members should be able to add new code to the existing system without changing any of the existing code.

Below is a code that violates the OCP:

```dart
class Shape {
  String type;
  Shape(this.type);
}

class AreaCalculator {
  double calculateArea(Shape shape) {
    if (shape.type == "circle") {
      return 3.14 * 3.14;
    }
    else if (shape.type == "rectangle") {
      return 4 * 5;
    }
    return 0;
  }
}
```

It violates the OCP because if you want to add a new shape (triangle, kite etc.), you have to modify the AreaCalculator class by modifying the calculateArea function by adding more if else conditions.

The code can be modified in the following way to follow the OCP:

```dart
abstract interface class Shape {
  double calculateArea();
}

class Circle implements Shape {
  double radius;
  Circle(this.radius);

  @override
  double calculateArea() {
    return 3.14 * radius * radius;
  }
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
  double length, breadth;

  Rectangle(this.length, this.breadth);

  @override
  double calculateArea() {
    return length * breadth;
  }
}

class AreaCalculator {
  double calculateArea(Shape shape) {
    return shape.calculateArea();
  }
}

void main() {
  Shape circle1 = Circle(3);
  Shape rect1 = Rectangle(2, 3);
  AreaCalculator calculator = AreaCalculator();

  double circle_area = calculator.calculateArea(circle1);
  double rect_area = calculator.calculateArea(rect1);
  print(circle_area);
  print(rect_area);
}
```

In this code, you can add any shape without making any change to the AreaCalculator class.

# Liskov Substitution

‚Äú**Derived or child classes must be substitutable for their base or parent classes**‚Äú

Breaking it down simply:

- If **class B** is a subclass of **class A**, then we should be able to replace **A** with **B** *without breaking the functionality*.
- The **child class** should **extend** the parent class **without changing its expected behavior**.

**An Example of Violation**

If you extend the above rectangle class to a square class and make it have equale sides, it will violate the characteristics of the rectangle class. If you need a square class, create a seperate one.

### **How to Follow LSP?**

‚úîÔ∏è A subclass **must** behave like its parent class without unexpected modifications.

‚úîÔ∏è Any function working with the **base class** should also work with **derived classes** seamlessly.

‚úîÔ∏è If a subclass **changes** the expected behavior, it **violates LSP**.

# Interface Segregation Principle

‚ÄúDo not force any client to implement an interface which is irrelevant to them.‚Äù

It‚Äôs similar to the single respinsibility principle.

Here your main goal is to focus on avoiding fat interface and give preference to many small client-specific interfaces. You should prefer many client interfaces rather than one general interface and each interface should have a specific responsibility.

Example:

```dart
abstract interface class ProblemSolver {
  void codeforces();
  void leetcode();
}

class CompetitiveProgrammer implements ProblemSolver {
  void codeforces() {
    print("Solving problem at Codeforces");
  }
  void leetcode() {
    print("Solving problem at Leetcode");
  }
}

class NonCompetitiveProgrammer implements ProblemSolver {
  void codeforces() {
    print("Solving problem at Codeforces");
  }
  void leetcode() {
    print("Solving problem at Leetcode");
  }
}
```

Here, both CompetitiveProgrammer and NonCompetitiveProgrammer extends the interface ProblemSolver hence both of them have to implement both methods codeforces and leetcode. But let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs not mandatory for a CompetitiveProgrammer to do Leetcode and it‚Äôs not mandatory for a NonCompetitiveProgrammer to do Codeforces. But in this implementation, both of them have to do both.

Solution: Make two different interfaces.

```dart
abstract interface class ProblemSolver_CP {
  void codeforces();
}

abstract interface class ProblemSolver_NCP {
  void leetcode();
}

class CompetitiveProgrammer implements ProblemSolver_CP {
  @override
  void codeforces() {
    print("Solving problem at Codeforces");
  }
}

class NonCompetitiveProgrammer implements ProblemSolver_NCP {
  @override
  void leetcode() {
    print("Solving problem at Leetcode");
  }
}
```

Now what if a NonCompetitiveProgrammer starts doing CF? Just make it implement both interfaces.

```dart
class NonCompetitiveProgrammer implements ProblemSolver_CP, ProblemSolver_NCP {
  @override
  void leetcode() {
    print("Solving problem at Leetcode");
  }
  @override
  void codeforces() {
    print("Solving problem at Codeforces");
  }
}
```

Question: Does this violate the Liskov substitution principle?
Ans: No.
Why?

```dart
void participateInCodeforces(ProblemSolver_CP programmer) {
  programmer.codeforces();
}

void participateInLeetcode(ProblemSolver_NCP programmer) {
  programmer.leetcode();
}

void main() {
  CompetitiveProgrammer cp = CompetitiveProgrammer();
  participateInCodeforces(cp); // Works fine

  NonCompetitiveProgrammer ncp = NonCompetitiveProgrammer();
  participateInCodeforces(ncp); // Also works

  participateInLeetcode(ncp); //Works as well
}
```

It does not change the behavior of the parent classes.

# Dependency Inversion

The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is a principle in object-oriented design that states that ‚Äú**High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions**‚Äú.

Example:

Suppose there is a room with a bulb in it. Here, room is a high-level module and bulb is a low-level module. If we implement it like this:

```dart
class IncandescentBulb {
  void turnOn() {
    print("Bulb turned on.");
  }
  void turnOff() {
    print("Bulb turned off.");
  }
}

class Room {
  IncandescentBulb bulb;
  Room(this.bulb);
  
  void switchLightOn() {
    bulb.turnOn();
  }
  
  void switchLightOff() {
    bulb.turnOff();
  }
}

void main() {
  IncandescentBulb bulb = IncandescentBulb();
  Room room = Room(bulb);
  room.switchLightOn();
}
```

The code works fine. But let‚Äôs say you want to change the incandescent bulb in the room into an LED one. If you do so, you have to modify the room class too which is undesirable. 

Solution?

Make an abstract interface class named bulb and make IncandescentBulb a subclass of it. If you want to add an LED bulb, simply create another subclass named LEDBulb that extends the Bulb class. This way you don‚Äôt have to modify the Room class.

```dart
abstract interface class Bulb {
  void turnOn();
  void turnOff();
}

class IncandescentBulb implements Bulb {
  @override
  void turnOn() {
    print("Incandescent bulb turned on.");
  }

  @override
  void turnOff() {
    print("Incandescent bulb turned off.");
  }
}

class LEDBulb implements Bulb {
  @override
  void turnOn() {
    print("LED bulb turned on.");
  }

  @override
  void turnOff() {
    print("LED bulb turned off.");
  }
}

class Room {
  Bulb bulb;
  Room(this.bulb);

  void switchLightOn() {
    bulb.turnOn();
  }

  void switchLightOff() {
    bulb.turnOff();
  }
}

void main() {
  Bulb in_bulb = IncandescentBulb();
  Bulb led_bulb = LEDBulb();
  Room room_with_led_bulb = Room(led_bulb);
  room_with_led_bulb.switchLightOn();
  Room room_with_in_bulb = Room(in_bulb);
  room_with_in_bulb.switchLightOn();
}
```
